### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I have a Bachelor of Science in Physics by the University of Brasilia with a
emphasis on Computational Physics. There I've developed my first programs in C,
like the [libmatrix](https://github.com/davifeliciano/libmatrix) library, and
learned Python, the programming language I used in many projects, like
[molecular_dynamics](https://github.com/davifeliciano/molecular_dynamics),
[ising_animate](https://github.com/davifeliciano/ising_animate) and
[num_opt_ga](https://github.com/davifeliciano/num_opt_ga) the latter being an
implementation of an Genetic Algorithm I've applied in my final thesis. I've
used Python along with Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib in the data analysis of many
relevant educational physics experiments, like
[stefan_boltzmann](https://github.com/davifeliciano/stefan_boltzmann),
[frank_hertz](https://github.com/davifeliciano/frank_hertz) and
[xrays](https://github.com/davifeliciano/xrays) (unfortunately, these repos lack
a documentation, but the results can be seen in the plots subdir). These
projects have introduced me to the field of Data Science, which I'm currently
exploring and learning from. Recently I've started to learn Web development using
Python, building small Flask applications like
[flask_blog](https://github.com/davifeliciano/flask_blog), working further to
expand my knowledge to other programming languages and frameworks. I'm also
enjoying learning Go reading the book "The Go Programming Language" by Brian
Kernighan and writing the exercises on the repository
[gobook](https://github.com/davifeliciano/gobook).
